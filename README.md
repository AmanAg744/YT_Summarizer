# YT_Summarizer
"I built a full-stack Python web app that takes any YouTube video URL, extracts the transcript, summarizes it using NLP, analyzes the sentiment, and displays everything in a clean dashboard built with Streamlit. It includes test coverage using Pytest and is CI/CD-enabled using GitHub Actions with live deployment on Streamlit Cloud."
